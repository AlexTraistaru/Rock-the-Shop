Rock the Shop is a C++ object-oriented application that simulates the management of an online rock merchandise store. The system handles employee management, stock control, order processing, and reporting.

# Features

Manage employees (add, modify, remove, view details).

Process and validate orders with automatic salary and bonus computation.

Distinguish between three employee roles: Manager, Order Operator, and Assistant, each with unique responsibilities and salary coefficients.

Validate personal data (CNP, name length, and age ≥ 18).

Simulate real-world business logic including hiring, resignations, and monthly bonuses.

Console-based menu for navigation across all management modules.

# Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)

Libraries: <string>, <iostream>, <fstream>, <ctime>

# How It Works

The application starts with a main menu offering options for:

Employee Management

Stock Management

Order Processing

Reports

The program validates input and displays messages when actions cannot be completed (e.g., store missing key personnel).

# Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates class design, inheritance hierarchies, data validation, and file-based persistence in a real-world business simulation.
